# Hydrogeology Codes
### A collection of notebooks that illustrate different aspects of hydrogeology

#### Flow to groundwater wells
- The [Theis](https://github.com/bradlipovsky/hydrogeo-codes/blob/main/theis.ipynb) solution for flow to a groundwater well from a confined non-leaky aquifer
- The [Hantush](https://github.com/bradlipovsky/hydrogeo-codes/blob/main/hantush.ipynb) solution for flow to a groundwater well from a confined leaky aquifer 
- The [Neuman-Witherspoon](https://github.com/bradlipovsky/hydrogeo-codes/blob/main/neuman-witherspoon.ipynb) solution for flow to a groundwater well from a confined leaky aquifer with elastic storage
- The [Neuman unconfined](https://github.com/bradlipovsky/hydrogeo-codes/blob/main/neuman-unconfined.ipynb) aquifer solution

#### Flownets
- Notebook illustrating [flownet "refraction"](https://github.com/bradlipovsky/hydrogeo-codes/blob/main/flownet-refraction.ipynb)
